<div class="dream">
    <p>I'm alive.</p>
    <p>Where am I?</p>
    <p>It's cold. So, so cold. Every exhale I give in to stings my lips. My teeth would be chattering, if only I could open my jaw.</p>
    <p>It's so dark. I can't see anything until I look straight down, where I can only find my pale, lifeless torso&mdash;yet I'm upright, and I can feel my heart beating more than I ever have.</p>
    <p>It beats... And it won't stop beating.</p>
    <p>It beats forward.</p>
    <p>I heave myself through the black cold and follow where it brings me.</p>
    <p>It's... Getting warm.</p>
    <p>Hope is enveloping me.</p>
    <p>I move with a slight energy now, improving my stance and dreaming of the outside.</p>
    <p>It's almost comfortably warm.</p>
    <p>My mind wanders. Why is it getting so hot?</p>
    <p>A sudden presence halts me where I am.</p>
    <p>Arms. Arms protruding from the dark, offering to hold me.</p>
    <p>I hesitantly give in. Stumbling forward, I fall toward the bright, warm hands.</p>
    <p>They're silken and homely. I feel saved from the piercing breeze.</p>
    <p>Not yet saved from the dark...</p>
    <p>...And as I open my mouth to thank, I see her face.</p>
    <p>Her wide, sharp grin stretches from one ear to the other, and her beady, brown pupils stare through and into my heart.</p>
    <p>The relief in my body swiftly melts into a paralyzing fear.</p>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p>Help me.</p>
    <p>Help me!</p>

<p>Lizz's heart races as she attempts to shake him out of his sleep.</p>
<p><em>"Damnit,</em> Chris, wake up!"</p>
<p><em>"HELP ME!!"</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>The room falls silent, and the two people in the room are at a standstill. Throughout the silence, she slowly loosens her grip on Chris's forearms. "I'm... Sorry. Did I shake you too hard?"</p>
<p>Chris pants harsh and rapidly. Looking up and around, he finds the warm, brown living room and himself on the wine-red, cottony couch with a red-haired Lizz kneeling to the side of him. When the silence starts to include the lack of panting, he takes a deep breath and, with a groan, opens his mouth to speak. "No. No, you're fine. I just..."</p>
<p>"Were you having another nightmare about her?"</p>
<p>"Her?"</p>
<p>"Brittany."</p>
<p>Chris lets out a deep sigh. "Brittany... Yeah. I was."</p>
<p>Lizz follows suit with another sigh. "Chris, I've been meaning to talk to you about her."</p>
<p>"Did you kill her?"</p>
<p>Lizz chuckles. "No, no. I haven't killed her."</p>
<p>Chris whispers a 'damnit' and lightly slams his fist against the couch.</p>
<p>"...But I think I know what's troubling you two."</p>
<p>Chris opens his eyes a bit. "I know what's troubling us. She's an asshole."</p>
<p>"No, Chris, I know <em>why</em> she's an asshole."</p>
<p>"She finds it fun."</p>
<p>Lizz presses her finger against Chris's lips. "There's more to it than that. I know it seems like she does this for her own enjoyment, but..."</p>
