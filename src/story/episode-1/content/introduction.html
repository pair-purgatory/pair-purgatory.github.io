<div class="dream">
    <p>
        I'm alive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where am I?
    </p>
    <p>
        A sharp breeze pierces my skin. The cold air reveals itself to me as my nerves
        begin to function. Every exhale I give in to stings my lips. My teeth should be
        chattering, if only I could open my jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
        My sense of sight doesn't assist me. Nowhere can I look to see anything but the
        color of pitch black, and I can only fear that I'm blind.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite the cold eventually numbing me to any outside feeling but its own
        offense, I can feel that I'm standing upright&mdash;that I've yet to fall over.
        A glimmer of hope sparks within me, and I begin to pull myself
        forward&mdash;wherever that is&mdash;hoping that I'll end up somewhere better
        than this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Heave... After heave... After heave.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nothing is changing. I've trailed through what feels like a dense mud for longer
        than I can recall, and the intense freeze begins to take hold.
    </p>
    <p>
        I tip forward and fall to my knees. The pain of the impact against the ground,
        suddenly solid, sends shockwaves through my body.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the last energy in my body, once devoted to panic, I begin to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
        My silent sobs echo through the desolate limbo, and despite the aching pain in
        the back of my eyes, my body won't allow itself to produce tears...
    </p>
    <p>
        ...Except one.
    </p>
    <p>
        It trickles down my cheek and lands on my thigh. Despite knowing there's nothing
        to see, I open my eyes, looking down at my legs. I can only find my own pale,
        nearly lifeless body. The relief of knowing my being is physically here with me
        is almost palpable itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking down at my own being, I can suddenly feel my heart beating.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm alive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before I can soak in the idea, my heart beats harder. It beats with a force.
    </p>
    <p>
        It beats forward.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hope I once had begins to shine again. I use the last bit of will I have to
        stand upright. My heart follows suit and pulls me forward with each beat.
    </p>
    <p>
        I heave myself through the black cold, following where it guides me.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's... Getting warm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hope envelopes me, and I lean forward, nearly disregarding my heart anymore.
        Dreams of the outside flood my mind as I move with greater speeds toward the
        warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's almost comfortably warm now. I can't help but let my mind wander. Why is it
        getting so hot?
    </p>
    <p>
        Before I can act on my questions, a sudden presence halts me where I am.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's... An arm. A pair of arms, protruding from the dark, offering to hold me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hesitantly give in. Stumbling forward, I fall toward the bright, warm hands.
    </p>
    <p>
        They're silken and homely. I feel saved from the piercing breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not yet saved from the dark...
    </p>
    <p>
        ...And before I can open my mouth to thank, I look up to see her face.
    </p>
    <p>
        Her wide, sharp grin stretches from one ear to the other, and her brown,
        boundless pupils stare through my meatless chest and into my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
        The relief in my body swiftly melts into a paralyzing fear.
    </p>
    <p>
        No.
    </p>
    <p>
        Help me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Help me!
    </p>

<p>
    Lizz's heart begins to race, incessantly shaking him out of his sleep.
    <em>"Damnit,</em> Chris, if I have to beat you with a hammer to get you
    to&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    <em>"HELP ME!!"</em>
