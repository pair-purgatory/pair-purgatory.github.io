<div class="dream">
    <p>
        I'm alive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where am I?
    </p>
    <p>
        A sharp breeze pierces my skin. The cold air reveals itself to me as my nerves begin to function. Every exhale I give in to stings my lips. My teeth should be chattering, if only I could open my jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
        My sense of sight doesn't assist me. Nowhere can I look to see anything but the color of pitch black, and I can only fear that I'm blind.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite the cold eventually numbing me to any outside feeling but its own offense, I can feel that I'm standing upright&mdash;that I've yet to fall over. A glimmer of hope sparks within me, and I begin to pull myself foward&mdash;wherever that is&mdash;hoping that I'll end up somewhere better than this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Heave... After heave... After heave.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nothing is changing. I've trailed through what feels like a dense mud for longer than I can recall, and the intense freeze begins to take hold.
    </p>
    <p>
        I tip forward and fall to my knees. The pain of the impact against the ground, suddenly solid, sends shockwaves through my body.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the last energy in my body, once devoted to panic, I begin to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
        My silent sobs echo through the desolate limbo, and despite the aching pain in the back of my eyes, my body won't allow itself to produce tears...
    </p>
    <p>
        ...Except one.
    </p>
    <p>
        It trickles down my cheek and lands on my thigh. Despite knowing there's nothing to see, I open my eyes, looking down at my legs. I can only find my own pale, nearly lifeless body. The relief of knowing my being is physically here with me is almost palpable itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking down at my own being, I can suddenly feel my heart beating.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm alive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before I can soak in the idea, my heart beats harder. It beats with a force.
    </p>
    <p>
        It beats forward.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hope I once had begins to shine again. I use the last bit of will I have to stand upright. My heart follows suit and pulls me forward with each beat.
    </p>
    <p>
        I heave myself through the black cold, following where it guides me.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's... Getting warm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hope envelopes me, and I lean forward, nearly disregarding my heart anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's almost comfortably warm.
    </p>
